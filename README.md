- 👋 Hi, I’m @NickInSynchronicity
- 👀 I’m interested in applying ROS2 onto industrial robotics application.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to transition from a robotics end user into a true robotics engineer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on customised cobot-type manipulator projects involving ROS2 platforms.
- 📫 Attempting to complete a part-time PhD programme at National University of Singapore so hit me up at Nickchew@nus.edu.sg
- ⚡ Fun fact: In the wise words of Reddit, learning robotics as an automation engineer and being a robotics engineer is a separate job.
